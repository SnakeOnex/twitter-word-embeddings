# Twitter word embeddings
Project I made in the 4th year of high school.

Script downloads a ton of english tweets from twitter, then turns them into embeddings using the Word2Vec algorithm. The project includes a webserver, that can be used to search through the embeddings. You search a specific word and the webserver finds 10 words with the most similar embeddings and displays them.
